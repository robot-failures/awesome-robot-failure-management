## Contributing

Feel free to make a pull request if you find something missing and / or to add new, relevant resources. If this is your first time contributing, please also include your name and link to your page (e.g. personal website) in the [list of contributors](contributors.md).

Contributions should follow the rules below:
* Resources should **explicitly** deal with some aspects of robot failures (for instance, this excludes resources where failure recovery is an emergent by-product of a learning process)
* The resources on all pages should **follow a chronological order** (starting from the most recent resources).
* When adding publications:
    * Please follow the existing format for structuring references (in particular, I follow the **IEEE reference format**).
    * Please **include the DOI whenever possible**. Preprints will only be accepted in exceptional cases (e.g. if a highly influential paper is only available as a preprint and has not been officially published anywhere, or if a workshop paper is included in the list).
* Robotics-adjacent resources will also be included **if they have relevance for robotics** (e.g. work on vision-based anomaly detection or work dealing with failures in autonomous driving).
* **Only resources that are available online in some form will be included** (e.g. workshop papers that haven't even been put on arXiv and thus cannot be downloaded will not be included).
