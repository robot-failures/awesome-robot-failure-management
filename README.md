## Contributing

Feel free to make a pull request if you find something missing and / or to add new, relevant resources. If this is your first time contributing, please also include your name and link to your page (e.g. personal website) in the [list of contributors](contributors.md).

Contributions should follow the rules below:
* When adding publications:
    * Please follow the existing format for structuring references (in particular, I follow the IEEE reference format).
    * Please include the DOI whenever possible. Preprints will only be accepted in exceptional cases (e.g. if a highly influential paper is only available as a preprint and has not been officially published anywhere).
* Robotics-adjacent resources will also be included if they have relevance for robotics (e.g. work on vision-based anomaly detection).
