# Relevant Workshops

The following is a list of workshops dedicated to robot failures that have taken place over the years. Note that generic workshops on failures (such as the International Conference on Principles of Diagnosis and Resilient Systems (DX)) or workshops dealing with complementary aspects (such as verification or software quality) are not included in the list.
